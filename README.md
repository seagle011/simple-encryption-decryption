# Encryption and Decryption GUI

This Python script demonstrates a simple GUI that allows users to encrypt and decrypt plaintext using a Caesar cipher.

# Usage

The GUI has two text areas: one for the plaintext and one for the ciphertext. To encrypt plaintext, enter the desired text in the plaintext text area and click the "Encrypt" button. The encrypted text will be displayed in the ciphertext text area. To decrypt ciphertext, enter the encrypted text in the ciphertext text area and click the "Decrypt" button. The decrypted text will be displayed in the plaintext text area.

The encryption algorithm used is a Caesar cipher, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. The number of positions to shift is determined by the "key" value, which is currently set to 3. This value can be changed as desired.
